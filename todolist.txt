CMAKE
-----

 - dependency binaries should be copied to the build repositories 
 - (cross-platform) distribution package generation

AOSL
----

 - add heavy documentation in the xsd file
 - use xs3p to generate the documentation from the xsd file
 ? objects should have comments

AOSLCPP
-------

 * (klaim) interpret/execute a sequence
 * (klaim) algorithms to manipulate a sequence
 - dispatch events from the execution of a sequence
 - add tests

AOS Designer

 ? move the files in /core in the global application directory (?)

 x (klaim) create a new project
 x (klaim) save the current project
 x (klaim) open and load a project
 - project properties edition
 
 x (klaim) add logging macros 
  x (klaim) that output in a file
   x in the Log view

  - add an hard config source file for constants
